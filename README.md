The fourth project from The Odin Project.

[Here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project) is the information for this project.

Project should utilize Git and GitHub.

First, The webpage should be initialized with a 16x16 square grid. I used document.createElement and .appendChild inside of a for loop to create a grid of divs in a container element in the HTML tree.

Next I incorporated .querySelectorAll, .forEach, event listeners and callbacks to develop a mouseover event that changes the background color of each div.

I added CSS variables to catch numbers entered by the user to set the number of columns and rows, as well as parameters to prevent NAN and empty strings.

Used Math.random to create color on mouseover, and remain changed.

To create a virtual "Etch-a-sketch" where when the user passes the mouse through a div, the div gets colored and remains colored until the grid is reset.

This Etch-a-Sketch project was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also used npm nodemon with this project.
